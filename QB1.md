Can you look at Preferences (Main Menu), then Backup (shown at left side of window). You likely have ticked the options “Remember current session for next launch” and/or “Enable session snapshot and periodic backup”.
I have both ticked and can edit a doc, then close NPP without it asking me about saving. When I re-open NPP I have the recent edits still showing, so I haven’t lost anything.
